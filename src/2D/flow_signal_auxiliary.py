def welch_parameters(num_bins: int, num_points: int, overlap: float):
    """
    Calculate parameters for welch method based on desired number of segments.

    This function divides the signal into a specific number of segments (bins)
    and calculates the necessary parameters for the welch method, including the
    size of each segment and the overlap between them.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    num_bins : int
        Desired number of segments to divide the signal into.
        Must be positive and cannot be larger than num_points.
    num_points : int
        Total number of points (samples) in the input signal.
        Must be positive and greater than num_bins.
    overlap : float, optional
        Overlap fraction between consecutive segments, in range [0, 1).

    Returns:
    --------
    nperseg : int
        Length of each segment in number of samples.
        This value is used as the 'nperseg' parameter in scipy.signal.welch.
    noverlap : int
        Number of overlapping points between consecutive segments.
        This value is used as the 'noverlap' parameter in scipy.signal.welch.
    freq_size : int
        Expected size of the frequency array returned by scipy.signal.welch.
        For real signals: freq_size = nperseg // 2 + 1 (due to FFT symmetry)

    psd_size : int
        Expected size of the frequency array and the power spectral density (PSD)
        array returned by scipy.signal.welch.
        For real signals: psd_size = nperseg // 2 + 1 (due to FFT symmetry)

    Raises:
    -------
    ValueError
        If overlap is not in range [0, 1) or if n_bins is too large
        for the available number of points (resulting in nperseg < 1).

    Notes:
    ------
    - This function assumes real signals (not complex)
    - The actual number of segments processed may be higher than n_bins due to overlap
    - Higher overlap results in better variance reduction, but higher computational cost
    - Frequency resolution is determined by nperseg: Î”f = fs / nperseg

    Examples:
    ---------
    >>> # Divide a 10000-point signal into 10 segments with 50% overlap
    >>> nperseg, noverlap, freq_size, psd_size = welch_setup(10, 10000, 0.5)
    >>> print(f"Segments of {nperseg} points with {noverlap} overlap points")
    Segments of 1000 points with 500 overlap points

    >>> # Use parameters with scipy.signal.welch
    >>> import scipy.signal as signal
    >>> frequencies, psd = signal.welch(x, fs=1000, nperseg=nperseg, noverlap=noverlap)
    >>> print(f"Got {len(frequencies)} frequency points and {len(psd)} PSD values")
